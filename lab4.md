### 3.
*  We need to choose a license so that the software could be a open source software which is freely used, modified, and shared. 
*  A license can make a software be used under some certain guidelines legally.
      
### 4.
*  There is legal risk if there is no explicit license
*  Since it is not legally a open source software, no one can redistributed it or make changes to it.
 
### 5.
*  I agree.  A platform which is easier to use or free would have more people to use it.
   When it is compaticable with more protocols, it becomes more flexible and has more potential.

### 6.
*  Because Apache license does not require the changes and derivatives of the software to use the same license. Thus, the project can be more 
   flexible. It is important to big project because there are different situations the project would meet so there must be different guidelines.
